    "Introduction:\n",
    "The basis for our code comes from David Pollard's 1982 paper, A simple ice sheet model yields realistic 100 glacial cycles. Pollard wanted to build of the previous work of Birchfield et al. and Oerlemans in order to produce an accurate model of the 100 kyr ice cycle. Pollard's goal was to create a model that that would closely follow the records of ice volume in glaciers for the past 700 kyr. Pollard's model differs from other previous models in the fact that it takes into account both topography and possible calving. These additions led to a model that matched the 700 kyr records more closely than any other model up to that point in time. It's important that scientists try to get their models to closely follow past data, because it means that said models will likely be more accurate in predicting the future. Glaciers are an incredibly important part of the earth’s climate system, and as global temperatures rise it has become clear that glaciers are shrinking at an alarming rate. The ability to accurately model glaciers is more important now than ever due to the effects of climate change. The main numerical method used in the paper is the Newton-Raphson method, which is applied to two equations separately. TALK ABOUT OTHER MODELS"

    "Equations: \n",
    "Northern hemisphere glacial cycles are quite complex and depend on quite a lot of variables. From historical records it can be observed that there is a dominant cycle of glacial ice volume that occurs over an 100 kyr period. The main equation used by Pollard is a simplified diffusion equation for ice thickness which is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} = A \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left[h^{\\alpha} \\left|\\frac{\\partial (h + h')}{\\partial x}\\right|^{\\beta} \\frac{\\partial (h + h')}{\\partial x}\\right] + G(h + h', x, \\text{orbit})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite a long formula, but once each term is defined it becomes much easier to understand. The variable t is time while x is the distance from north to south. h' is defined as the elevation of the bedrock surface above a fixed point, which in this case is the mean sea level from 1982. This formula is also made up of some constants, A is one such constant that is equal to 5.77e-4 1/m^3*yr. Alpha and beta are also constants, equal to 5 and 2 respectively. The northern boundary of the model is 74° N while the southern boundary is taken to be 30° N. At these points h = 0 which is to prevent ice formation in the arctic and tropics. G is the net annual mass balance on the ice surface and is dependent on a separate set of equations, which is the following: \n",
